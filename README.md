# DeepLearningForPCAP
For my final project for my Deep Learning Class CSCI-E89 at the Harvard Extention School


# Data Source
The data for the project was downloaded from the University of Victoria's Website here
- https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/isot/datasets/
Specifically, I downloaded the ISOT HTTP Notenet Dataset from here
- https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/isot/2022/11/27/botnet-and-ransomware-detection-datasets/

This dataset looks at HTTP traffic.
