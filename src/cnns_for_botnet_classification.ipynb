One such vulnerability is a botnet attack. In a botnet attack, a malicious actor takes over one or many computers and uses them for their own purposes. Some common uses for botnets is that they conduct Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, spread spam or misinformation, or conduct phishing attacks.\n","\n","In some instances, botnets communicate with a central server which gives commands to the individual machines. This communication often happens via Domain Name System (DNS) traffic, because a DNS request may get bounced back and forth between multiple DNS servers.\n","\n","\n","Source:\n","- https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/botnet\n","\n","### Packet Capture\n","\n","Packet capture for DNS involves capturing and analyzing network traffic specifically related to the Domain Name System (DNS). It entails capturing individual data packets exchanged during DNS transactions to examine communication patterns, identify queries, and analyze responses between DNS clients and servers. For the purposes of this project, I explore whether we can detect any distinction between the DNS packets sent from different botnets and other normal DNS traffic.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"7ArbUTS22_PU"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## The Dataset\n","\n","To explore the relationship between botnet and non-malicious DNS packets, I utilize a publicly available dataset from the University of Victoria. This is a publicly available dataset in which the researchers constructed virtual machines and deployed 9 different botnets and captured all internet traffic inside their network.  They also deployed a number of non-malicious software, such as Skype, Windows Updater, Dropbox, and others.  Helpfully for this work, they also identified the Command and Control servers of for each of the botnets. This dataset contains all internet traffic observed in the virtual environemnt, however I will focus just on the DNS traffic for this analysis.\n","\n","\n","### Link to Dataset\n","https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/isot/datasets/"],"metadata":{"id":"agEKRH9F4JlW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Overview of Solution\n","\n","To explore the relationship between botnet DNS traffic and different applications, I construct multiple Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and assess them on their accuracy on a testing set. Given the fact that an individual DNS connection consists of a number of packets, each containing strings of binary data, this a CNN is a good model choice. CNNs create and apply many filters over an input tensor.  Given that binary data quickly becomes uninterpretable to humans, it is better to let the CNN do the feature engineering on its own.\n","\n","I explore various depths and kernel sizes. I do not have a strong prior about what the appropriate values for these should be in this CNN so I begin at a very low number and work my way up, incrementally adding another Convolutional Layer and increasing the kernel size."],"metadata":{"id":"8Obhcpr44NST"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Preparing My Environment\n","### PYSHARK\n","\n","This analysis notebook was largely built and run using my Google Colab premium account. However, the prelimiary python scripts I used to prepare the data are raw python files (.py) and must be run outside of a standard notebook. This is because the pyshark module that I used to manipulate the packet-level data runs in an event loop. Google Colab Notebooks run in an event loop and python will not allow you run nested event loops, therefore this preliminary section must be run outside of a notebook. Futher, the pyshark library is a wrapper for the \"tshark\" application, which must be installed on the machine as well. That is why you see the command to install it below.\n","\n","\n","### GOOGLE DRIVE\n","The raw data and the intermediate files I save were stored in my Google Drive. I have a premium Google Drive subscription, with 150 Gb of storage available. This is important to note because the raw data as well as the tenors that I save are too large to fit within the standard Google Drive limits.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"hSQlxky70taZ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive/')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"icq7aB_opwwL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1702218096634,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":602886,"user":{"displayName":"Bryce Turner","userId":"13403693330114789249"}},"outputId":"6400a1ae-c08a-4d41-9961-217f798a1d64"},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive/\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!sudo apt install tshark"],"metadata":{"id":"m1i1tTjjyGjI"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%pip install pyshark"],"metadata":{"id":"50CUlkbQq8wJ"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Data Preparation\n","\n","Getting the data into a usable state required a significant amount of prep work.

I spent a large portion of my time constrcting and manipulating the data into a usable shape, which will make future endevors in this field easier.\n","\n","In terms of model preformance, I believe that there is more work to be done but that this is an important first step. The DNS traffic clearly has some patterns to it, but given the very high accuracy observed I suspect that this model would not perform well if it were to be deployed in the field.\n","\n","I also want to thank my Professors and TAs for their time this semester. We covered a lot of different topics and the homeworks were in depth and interesting. I know that they all put a lot of time and effort into constructing the course, and it does not go unnoticed and unappreciated.
