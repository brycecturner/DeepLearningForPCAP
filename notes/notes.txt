I am only extracting DNS data
This is basically because I don't understand the rest of the traffic but I think its fine for the purposes of this project.
DNS typically uses UDP but may use TCP if the packets are too big for UDP. 

I filtered out the traffic to JUST look at DNS packets. I did this manipulating inside of wireshark, which was easier 
  and faster than doing it via pyshark

  I am excluding the ips that aren't explicitly accounted for in the pdf document. I may be misunderstanding something but at this point I'm moving forward.
